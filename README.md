# Java8StreamAPIProgramming
Java8 Stream API Programming 
This standalone java project is differnt from all sources towards reprsentation or sharing knowledge on programs of Java8 using stream API.
**The main purpose is for the public to read and contribute to this project so that all unique stream programs are being captured and make Java functional syle coding easy.**
The project is catergorized into Primitives, Strings and Objects with advanced level & expert level of programming using Stream API intermediate & terminal APIs.
1. Primitives Programs:
   This project will have Java8 programs on all Collections related DS but not Strings (for ease of understanding & operations on numbers compared with texts/strings).
   The advanced level code will have basic idea/style of using maximum intermediate apis with ouput of the code using terminal apis(Filter, Map).
   The expert level code will have the actual enterprise level code which uses key metohods of stream api which is essential for complex logic(groupingBy,MapToObj etc).
2. Strings Programs:
   This project will have Java8 programs on all Collections related DS with Strings (for ease of understanding & operations on numbers compared with texts/strings).
   The advanced level code will have basic idea/style of using maximum intermediate apis with ouput of the code using terminal apis(Map,Chars()).
   The expert level code will have the actual enterprise level code which uses key metohods of stream api which is essential for complex logic(groupingBy, etc).
3. Oject Programs:
   This project will have Java8 programs on all Collections related DS with Java Objects (to apply Primitives & String programs on realtime Java Objects).
   The advanced level code will have basic idea/style of using maximum intermediate apis with ouput of the code using terminal apis(Map,Chars()).
   The expert level code will have the actual enterprise level code which uses key metohods of stream api which is essential for complex logic(groupingBy, etc).

The struture of the project is analogous to any enterprise level arhictecture towards Spring MVC pattern.The service layer is an inteface with static methods for each of the get the required Java8 stream API code.The main Java program will just invoke the service method.

The memory is stub with an array or maybe a Lists with primitives or Strings depending on the context and the idea is making the concept of functional progeamming using Stream API easy!!!
